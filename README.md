This repository is an actively maintained fork of [`badlogic/pi-telegram`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-telegram). It started from upstream commit [`cb34008460b6c1ca036d92322f69d87f626be0fc`](https://github.com/badlogic/pi-telegram/commit/cb34008460b6c1ca036d92322f69d87f626be0fc) and has since diverged substantially.

## Key Features

- **Immediate Telegram Controls**: `/status` and `/model` respond immediately from Telegram, while model-switch continuation turns still use the control lane when a restart needs to resume safely.
- **Interactive UI**: Manage your session directly from Telegram. Inline buttons allow you to switch models and adjust reasoning (thinking) levels on the fly.
- **In-flight Model Switching**: Change the active model mid-generation. The agent gracefully pauses, applies the new model, and restarts its response without losing context.
- **Smart Message Queue**: Messages sent while the agent is busy are queued and previewed in the pi status bar, and queued turns can be reprioritized or removed with Telegram reactions.
- **Mobile-Optimized Rendering**: Tables and lists are formatted for narrow screens, table padding accounts for emoji grapheme and wide Unicode display width, and Telegram-originated runs prompt the assistant to prefer narrow table columns for phone readability. Markdown is correctly parsed and split to fit Telegram's limits without breaking HTML structures or code blocks, block spacing stays faithful to the original Markdown with readable heading separation, supported absolute links stay clickable, and unsupported link forms degrade safely.
- **File Handling & Attachments**: Send images and files to the agent, transcribe or transform inbound files with configured attachment handlers, or ask pi to generate and return artifacts. Inbound downloads and outbound attachments are size-limited by default, and outbound files are delivered automatically via the `telegram_attach` tool.
- **Streaming Responses**: Closed Markdown blocks stream back as rich Telegram HTML while pi is generating, and the still-growing tail stays readable until the final fully rendered reply lands.

## Install

From npm:

```bash
pi install npm:@llblab/pi-telegram
```

From git:

```bash
pi install git:github.com/llblab/pi-telegram
```

## Configure

### 1. Telegram Bot

1. Open [@BotFather](https://t.me/BotFather)
2. Run `/newbot`
3. Pick a name and username
4. Copy the bot token

### 2. Configure the extension in pi

Start pi, then run:

```bash
/telegram-setup
```

Paste your bot token when prompted. If a bot token is already saved in `~/.pi/agent/telegram.json`, the setup prompt shows that stored value by default. Otherwise it prefills from the first configured environment variable in `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`, `TELEGRAM_BOT_KEY`, `TELEGRAM_TOKEN`, or `TELEGRAM_KEY`. The saved config file is written with private `0600` permissions.

### 3. Connect this pi session

```bash
/telegram-connect
```

The bridge is session-local: only one pi instance polls Telegram at a time. `/telegram-connect` records polling ownership in `~/.pi/agent/locks.json`; live ownership moves require confirmation, while `/new` and same-`cwd` process restarts resume automatically.

### 4. Pair your account from Telegram

1. Open the DM with your bot in Telegram
2. Send `/start`

The first user to message the bot becomes the exclusive owner of the bridge. The extension will only accept messages from this user.

## Usage

Once paired, simply chat with your bot in Telegram. All text, images, and files are forwarded to pi.

### Telegram Commands & Controls

Use these inside the Telegram DM with your bot:

- **`/start`**: Pair the first Telegram user when needed, register the bot command menu, and show help.
- **`/help`**: Show the Telegram help text.
- **`/status`**: View session stats, cost, and use inline buttons to change models.
- **`/model`**: Open the interactive model selector.
- **`/compact`**: Start session compaction (only works when the session is idle).
- **`/stop`**: Abort the active run and clear all waiting Telegram queue items.

Telegram command admission is explicit: `/compact`, `/stop`, `/help`, `/start`, `/status`, and `/model` execute immediately. Synthetic model-switch continuation turns still enter the high-priority control lane so they can resume before normal queued prompts when pi becomes safe to dispatch.

### Pi Commands

Run these inside pi, not Telegram:

- **`/telegram-setup`**: Configure or update the Telegram bot token.
- **`/telegram-status`**: Check bridge status, connection, polling, execution, queue, and recent redacted runtime/API failure events.
- **`/telegram-connect`**: Start polling Telegram updates in the current pi session, acquire the singleton lock, or interactively move ownership here from another live instance.
- **`/telegram-disconnect`**: Stop polling in the current pi session and release the singleton lock.

### Queue, Reactions, and Media

- If you send more Telegram messages while pi is busy, they enter the default prompt queue and are processed in order.
- `👍` moves a waiting prompt into the priority prompt queue, behind control actions but ahead of default prompts. Removing `👍` sends it back to its normal queue position, and adding `👍` again gives it a fresh priority position.
- `👎` removes a waiting turn from the queue. Telegram Bot API does not expose ordinary DM message-deletion events through the polling path used here, so queue removal is bound to the dislike reaction.
- Reactions apply to any waiting Telegram turn, including text, voice, files, images, and media groups. For media groups, a reaction on any message in the group applies to the whole queued turn.
- If you edit a Telegram message while it is still waiting in the queue, the queued turn is updated instead of creating a duplicate prompt. Edits after a turn has already started may not affect the active run.
- Telegram replies to earlier text or caption messages are forwarded as `[reply]` context for normal prompts, while slash commands still parse from the new message text only.
- Inbound images, albums, and files are saved to `~/.pi/agent/tmp/telegram`. Unhandled local file paths are included in the prompt, handled attachment output is injected into the prompt text, and inbound images are forwarded to pi as image inputs. Inbound downloads default to a 50 MiB limit and can be adjusted with `PI_TELEGRAM_INBOUND_FILE_MAX_BYTES` or `TELEGRAM_MAX_FILE_SIZE_BYTES`.
- Queue reactions depend on Telegram delivering `message_reaction` updates for your bot and chat type.

### Inbound Attachment Handlers

`telegram.json` can define ordered `attachmentHandlers` for common preprocessing such as voice transcription. Matching handlers run after download and before the Telegram turn enters the pi queue. If a matching handler fails, the next matching handler is tried as a fallback.

```json
{
  "attachmentHandlers": [
    {
      "type": "voice",
      "template": "/path/to/stt1 --file {file} --lang {lang=ru}",
      "timeout": 30000
    },
    {
      "mime": "audio/*",
      "template": "/path/to/stt2 --file {file} --lang {lang=ru}",
      "timeout": 30000
    }
  ]
}
```

Matching supports `mime`, `type`, or `match`; wildcards like `audio/*` are accepted. Handlers use `template`: a string is one command, and an array is ordered composition. Template placeholders are substituted into command args, not shell text: `{file}` is the downloaded file path, `{mime}` is the MIME type, `{type}` is the Telegram attachment type, and `defaults` or inline defaults such as `{lang=ru}` can provide additional values. Examples use explicit flag-style CLIs for readability; positional script forms are also supported when the script itself supports them. Local attachments stay in the prompt under `[attachments] <directory>` with relative file entries; successful handler stdout is added under `[outputs]`; failed handlers record diagnostics and fall back to the next matching handler. The portable command-template contract is documented in [`docs/command-templates.md`](./docs/command-templates.md); Telegram-specific handler config is documented in [`docs/attachment-handlers.md`](./docs/attachment-handlers.md).

### Requesting Files

If you ask pi for a file or generated artifact (e.g., _"generate a shell script and attach it"_), pi can call the `telegram_attach` tool, and the extension will send the file alongside its next Telegram reply. `telegram_attach` is the only pi tool registered by `pi-telegram`; use it for ordinary files, not for Telegram-native voice or buttons. Outbound attachments default to a 50 MiB limit and can be adjusted with `PI_TELEGRAM_OUTBOUND_ATTACHMENT_MAX_BYTES` or `TELEGRAM_MAX_ATTACHMENT_SIZE_BYTES`.

### Assistant-Authored Outbound Actions

Assistant replies can include hidden outbound blocks. `telegram_voice` and `telegram_button` are not pi tools; they are assistant-authored HTML comments that the bridge removes from Telegram text and handles after `agent_end`. Action comments are recognized only as top-level column-zero blocks outside fenced code, quotes, and lists, so documentation examples remain literal. This is faster than agent-side tool calls because the agent only writes correctly formatted Markdown in its normal answer; the extension builds the configured voice pipeline, button markup, and callback routing itself without registering or invoking extra transport/TTS/text-to-OGG tools.

#### Voice

Voice blocks synthesize their body and upload it as a native Telegram `sendVoice` OGG/Opus message. The body may be a concise companion summary, but it does not have to follow that format; write the text you want spoken and keep it TTS-friendly:

```md
Full technical answer stays readable as text.

<!-- telegram_voice lang=ru rate=+30%
Text to synthesize as a Telegram voice message.
-->
```

Outbound voice is disabled unless a matching `outboundHandlers[]` entry is configured. Multiple `telegram_voice` blocks in one reply are synthesized and sent independently, preserving each block's attributes. The bridge uses the same [command-template contract](./docs/command-templates.md) as inbound attachment handlers: split the template into args, substitute placeholders, execute without a shell, and use stdout as the result channel for a single template.

A TTS plus MP3-to-OGG setup can be expressed as `template: [...]`. The bridge provides `{text}`, `{mp3}`, and `{ogg}` to every step; top-level `args`/`defaults` apply to all steps unless a step defines private values, top-level `timeout` wraps the whole sequence, and each step's stdout is passed to the next step's stdin by default. Use `"output": "ogg"` when the artifact path should come from the generated `{ogg}` value instead of final stdout:

```json
{
  "outboundHandlers": [
    {
      "type": "voice",
      "template": [
        "/path/to/tts --text {text} --lang {lang=ru} --rate {rate=+30%} --write-media {mp3}",
        "ffmpeg -y -i {mp3} -c:a libopus -b:a 32k -ar 16000 -ac 1 -vbr on {ogg}"
      ],
      "output": "ogg",
      "timeout": 60000
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Buttons

Button blocks attach inline quick replies to the final text. Use one independent `telegram_button` block per action; its `label` is shown in Telegram and its body is sent back to pi when tapped:

```md
I can continue.

<!-- telegram_button label="Continue"
Continue with the current plan.
-->
```

Button prompts are routed back into the normal Telegram queue as prompt turns. Outbound handler details are documented in [`docs/outbound-handlers.md`](./docs/outbound-handlers.md).

## Streaming

The extension streams assistant previews back to Telegram while pi is generating.

Rich previews are sent through editable messages because Telegram drafts are text-only. Closed top-level Markdown blocks can appear with formatting before the answer finishes, while the still-growing tail remains conservative and readable until the preview is replaced with the fully rendered Telegram HTML reply. Editable preview messages are also attached as replies to the source Telegram prompt when possible.

## Status bar

The pi status bar shows the current bridge state plus queued Telegram turns as compact previews. Busy labels distinguish states such as `active`, `dispatching`, `queued`, `tool running`, `model`, and `compacting`.

```text
telegram queued +3: [⬆ write a shell script…, summarize this image…, 📎 2 attachments]
```

## Notes

- Replies to Telegram prompts are sent as Telegram replies to the source message when possible; if the source message is unavailable, delivery falls back to a normal message
- Long replies are split below Telegram's 4096 character limit without intentionally breaking Telegram HTML formatting; only the first split message is attached as a Telegram reply to the source prompt
- Temporary inbound Telegram files are cleaned up on later session starts
